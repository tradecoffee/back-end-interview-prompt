# Trade Back End Interview Prompt

##  Part 1 (Ruby / Sort Algorithm)

First things first, let’s write that recommendation logic! Given a list of ~200 coffees (See: `data/coffees.json` file (~22kb)), let’s write a program that fulfills these requirements:

- Gets data from the `coffees.json` file.
- Sorts the coffees by `score` values, descending (higher `score` is better tasting coffee, so we want those at the top).
- Returns an array of `name`s of the top 3 coffees with the greatest `score` values. In the event of a tie, either `name` is fine.

```ruby
# Example output:

['Best Blend', 'Better Blend', 'Good Blend']
```

```ruby
# Write your solution here!
