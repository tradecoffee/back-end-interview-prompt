# Trade Back End Interview Prompt

## Part 4: Thinking at Scale

Business is booming and Rad Coffee is rapidly becoming a billion-dollar company with **millions of daily active users**! Itâ€™s time to think about scaling your application.

Assuming you have all the time & resources you need to build whatever you can think of:

1. Which part(s) of your application could be a potential performance bottleneck in this situation? What could you do to resolve or mitigate them?
2. What changes could you make to your application (or any part of the stack) to handle this level of concurrent users?
3. How would you handle a database (or file) containing millions of coffees instead of just 200?
