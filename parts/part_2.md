# Trade Back End Interview Prompt

## Part 2

Great! Now we want to expose our recommendation logic to the public, by creating an API to expose it. Using Rails (or any web framework/library), create an API endpoint that can:

- Take an optional integer param, `limit`, and only return the top n coffees.
    - If param is not provided, default to `limit` = `3`.
- Take an optional boolean param, `is_decaf`, and only return top coffees with the provided `is_decaf` value (`true` or `false`).
    - If param is not provided, default to `is_decaf`= `false`.
