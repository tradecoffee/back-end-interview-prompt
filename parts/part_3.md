# Trade Back End Interview Prompt

## Part 3

Your non-technical cofounder was able to dig through some market data and one thing was very clear — users want to be able to **“Like”** their favorite coffees!

Adding on to what you’ve built so far, implement a way for users of your API to:

- Add coffees to their “Liked” collection.
- Remove coffees from their “Liked” collection.
- View a user’s “Liked” collection. (Your API should return this list as JSON)

> 🔑 For this part, do not worry about implementing authentication/authorization. Let’s pretend that it is already implemented and that all clients hitting the API are correctly auth’ed.
